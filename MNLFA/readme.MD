MNLFA for the RBS-EC was performed using the aMNLFA package in R (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/aMNLFA/index.html).  
The authors made slight modifications to the package functions, which are included in this folder.  

<b> Changes to functions </b>. 
1. aMNLFA_sample.R. Modified function so that user can enter indices for calibration sample. This was done so that calibration samples that were similar in age distributions could be created and used (see <b>find_balanced_sample.R</b>).
