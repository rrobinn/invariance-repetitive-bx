MNLFA for the RBS-EC was performed using the aMNLFA package in R (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/aMNLFA/index.html).  
The authors made slight modifications to the package functions (e.g. allowed user to enter specific calibration sample for aMNLFA_sample.R) which are included in this folder.
